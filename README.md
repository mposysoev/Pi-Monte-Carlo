# Calculation Pi number using Monte Carlo algorithm

This repository is aimed to be collection of implementations of a simple Monte Carlo algorithm for computing Pi number. In the future, I'm going to add more different programming languages and make a benchmark.

## List of programming languages
- Python
- Rust
- ...


## Benchmark
All measurements were made with using [Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) on laptop Intel i3-5005U, 2.00 GHz.
