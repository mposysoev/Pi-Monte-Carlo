# Calculation Pi number using Monte Carlo algorithm

This repository is aimed to be collection of implementations of a simple Monte Carlo algorithm for computing Pi number. 


## Benchmark
All measurements were made with using [Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) on laptop Intel i3-5005U, 2.00 GHz.

```
Number of iterations = 1_000_000
```
Future: do banchmark with bigger number of iterations and more accurate

* -- Odin output 3.141. It seems that this language still doesn't have full support of float64 type. Required test after next release.
